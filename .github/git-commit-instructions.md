# Git Commit Message Instructions

Please follow these guidelines when writing commit messages:

Subject line:
- Write a short summary of the change in imperative mood
  (e.g., "Fix bug in parser", "Add API for post count").
- Keep the subject line to 50 characters or fewer.
- Capitalize the first word of the subject line.
- Do not end the subject line with a period.
- Use only one subject line (no multiple sentences).

Body (when needed):
- Leave a blank line between the subject line and the body.
- Explain what changed and why it changed, not just how.
- Wrap body lines at around 72 characters.
- Use short paragraphs for explanations.
- Use bullet points only when listing multiple distinct changes.
- When using bullets, start each bullet with a verb
  (e.g., "Add", "Remove", "Refactor").
- Mention specific classes, methods, or files when relevant.
- Be consistent in tense and voice throughout the message.

Footer (optional):
- Add a footer line when referencing issues or tickets, e.g.:
  - `Refs: #123`
  - `Fixes: #456`
